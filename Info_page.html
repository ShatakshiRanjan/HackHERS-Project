                            One hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters. To put this into perspective, it is equal to 13 baseball fields and 2 white houses. It's also big enough to fit 12 blue whales. In just 40 years, 1 billion hectares have been cut down.

                            What are the effects to this? Habitats are disappearing, which means more species cannot live. Water will be contaminated, which equates to less drinking water for all. Soil erosion will occur, and the forest will turn into a desert.
